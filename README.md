# Hasher

Hasher is a very simple hashing tool which will calculate the SHA256 (including Base64), SHA1 (including Base64) and MD5 hashes for a given file or set of files. You can simply drag and drop a file or directory over the tool and it will compute the hashes for you. All output is displayed in a console window.
